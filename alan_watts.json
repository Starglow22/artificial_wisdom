in London, at the World Congress of Faiths, when Suzuki Daisetsu was present\u2014he\u2019s the one who\u2019s written all the essays on Zen Buddhism; the great scholar\u2014and he had made a very,

themselves of volumes of hot air.", " Finally, Suzuki was the last speaker.", " And he got up and he said, approximately, \u201cI am feeling very confused tonight.", " I am simple countryman from a faraway place, and I find myself in this assembly of so many people.", " I am asked to talk about supreme spiritual ideal.", " Seems to me, I do not know what supreme spiritual ideal is, so I look up

right.", " You have spiritual over here, you have material world over here.", " And both are unreal.", "\u201d And then he went on to give a description of his house and garden in Japan.", " And at the end of it, he had a standing ovation, for\u2014somehow\u2014he was real; he came across as somebody who\u2019s lovable, intelligible and human, as distinct from a mere preacher.", "And he made this intensely important point that if you understand the spiritual correctly, it is not different from the material.", " The material is the spiritual.", " But in order to see why that is so, one first has to make a clear difference between the material and the abstract and to understand that the abstract doesn\u2019t mean the same thing as the spiritual.", " The abstract world is a world of symbols, a world of words, a world of concepts which has the same relation to the physical universe as the menu to the dinner, or as money to wealth\u2014I mean money in the sense of bookkeeping entries in a bank or dollar bills.", " One must be very careful, therefore, not to confuse the spiritual and the abstract.", " If by the spiritual we designate the domain of ultimate reality\u2014the unified or, more strictly, non-dual energy of the universe that I was talking about this morning\u2014that has nothing whatsoever, really, to do with abstractions.", " What we call physical reality\u2014the material world\u2014is much closer to what would be meant by \u2018spiritual\u2019 than anything abstract is.", " But the thing is that when we form in our minds\u2014the average person who talks about the physical world, he has a concept of the physical world which is what really should be referred to as \u2018materiality\u2019 when one uses that word in a put-down way.", "If, for example, we talk about\u2014I could even say this to theologians and they would eventually understand me\u2014if we talk about the evils of the flesh, the word \u2018the flesh\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean the body in the sense of this [Alan (presumably) indicates at his own body].", " The flesh, as something evil, represents a conception of the body as something to be exploited in order to satisfy one\u2019s spiritual emptiness.", " And thus, too, when we speak of materialism: we aren\u2019t really talking about materialism, we\u2019re talking about an abstract conception of the value of the material world.", " Real materialism would, of course, be the love of material, which is something quite different from materialism as one sees it in practice.", " So it\u2019s very important to realize that when we say \u201cthe physical world\u201d and we talk about matter as something which is antithetical to the spiritual, you are not talking about this [Alan indicates at his body] because all this doesn\u2019t have those kind of qualities that we would call materiality as against the spiritual.", " If you really get in touch with your senses, with the so-called physical world, you\u2019re in for many surprises.", "First of all\u2014if you go back to the point I made that there really is only the present\u2014you will see that what we call this physical world is not something expanded in time, stretched out over time, and it is not material also in the sense of being composed of stuff.", " You see, one of our problems in the West is we think about the relationship of the spiritual to the physical by analogy with form and matter, or rather, with clay as matter and the form as the pot made out of the clay.", " And therefore, we\u2019ve never been able to put the two together because our conception of matter as something essentially like clay\u2014a sort of primordial stuff\u2014this has no intelligence, nor does it possess energy.", " Therefore, when you think of the world as a sort of cooperation\u2014or a mixture of form and matter\u2014you have, therefore, to invoke an external agency to inform matter and to bring it into shape, to order it, and to produce art.", "But this dualism of form and matter is really rather meaningless.", " Nobody ever saw an immaterial form or a formless material.", " There really is no such thing as \u2018stuff\u2019 out of which the universe is made.", " \u2018Stuff\u2019 is actually a word for looking at the world with bad focus.", " When your focus on something is not clear, it is fuzzy.", " And this fuzziness, or indistinctness, is \u2018stuff.", "\u2019 When your focus on the world is clear, you see pattern, you see details, you see structure.", " Now, as you look more deeply into any structure it starts to get fuzzy again, and therefore, you ask \u201cOf what stuff is this structure made?\u201d \u2018Stuff\u2019 meaning fuzz.", " But then again, when you turn up the level of magnification and it once again becomes bright and clear, you see within the great structures and the great patterns smaller ones.", "So, you always encounter the world as patterning, never as stuff.", " And so, our physical world that surrounds us is, in a way, immaterial.", " It is a fantastic pulsation of vibrations which give an illusion of solidity in just the same way as if I take a lighted cigarette in the dark and rapidly revolve it, you get the illusion of a continuous circle of fire.", " So, the apparent motion of the present moment from the past to the future gives an illusion of continuity as if there were something extended in time.", " And in exactly the same way, the table\u2014because it is vibrating with such tremendous energy\u2014gives the illusion of solidity in exactly the same way as the blades of a propeller or an electric fan when they\u2019re in rotation.", " And in the same way as you\u2019ll come to trouble if you try to put your finger through the fan, the only reason you can\u2019t get your finger through the table: it\u2019s going even faster than a fan, and it bounces your finger off.", " When you feel hardness your finger is being bounced off because of this tremendous energy that lies in and as the table.", " Likewise, it\u2019s also in your finger.", "So, what we\u2019re actually confronted with, what is here and now\u2014nowever\u2014is certainly not a material world as we ordinarily conceive it, but is something intensely magical and strange.", " And the more\u2014Spinoza once said, \u201cThe more you know of particular things, the more you know of God.", "\u201d And then, put it in another way: if you want to find out what is the spiritual, what is Buddha-nature, what is Brahman, what is Tao, the best way is to go directly to the physical world and find out: the physical world as you are it, and as everything around you is it; the immediate experience.", "Now, to go back.", " This, as I said, is something which our culture\u2014which WASP culture in particular\u2014neglects, because we are obsessed with abstract attainments.", " And this goes back to some curious factors in our history.", " To introduce this matter I have to refresh your minds about caste, strangely enough.", " In ancient Hindu society, there are four castes, respectively: brahmins, who are priests, theologians, philosophers, and intellectuals; k\u1e63atriya, who are warriors and rulers, politicians; vaishya, who are merchants; and shudra, who are laborers, blue-collar workers.", " These castes have something peculiar about them in the fact that they are eternal\u2014let me say perennial.", " They still exist, even though we don\u2019t admit it.", " There are k\u1e63atria people around and they are very different from brahmins.", " The typical fraternity American with his crew cut and his\u2014uses alcohol, is agressive, likes football, and so on\u2014he\u2019s a k\u1e63atria type.", " The professorial, quiet fellow is a brahmin.", " The businessman is a vaishya, and our blue-collar people are shudras.", " They\u2019re still there.", " And they\u2019re all necessary to each other; they balance each other in a very fascinating way.", " The brahmin cannot get on by himself, he needs the k\u1e63atria, the vaishya, and the shudra.", " And likewise, every one of them needs the others.", "But there was a curious revolution in Europe at the time we call the Reformation.", " When the vaishyas got the upper hand of the brahmins and the k\u1e63atrias, the feudal aristocracy began to lose power in the face of, say, the great merchant bankers of Italy and the burghers of central Europe.", " The brahmins, who were the priests of the Roman Catholic church, began to lose power because their doctrine was criticized and fell under suspicion.", " For, you must see that the Protestant religion was the creation of the burgher cities of Europe, of places like Geneva, Frankfurt, and\u2014one must add\u2014London, Edinburgh.", " And immediately, money values began to dominate Christian theology.", " For example, the number of holy days was very strictly cut down by on Protestant sects because those were holidays and the merchants didn\u2019t want their apprentices taking all these holidays off an not busying themselves.", " And so, always connected with the Protestant ethic are the virtues of frugality, saving money, saving up for the future, and in such things are vaishya ideals running a bit wild.", " And thus, you see, the common-sense ethic\u2014that is to say, the basic conception of the good life as it is held in the United States\u2014is very largely a creation of bourgeois Protestantism.", " We have a very bad relation to the material present.", " Because that\u2019s one thing that the vaishya can\u2019t maintain by himself anymore than the brahmin or the k\u1e63atria or the shudra could maintain it by himself.", "We have a whole world based on these two things: save up, there\u2019s a good time coming\u2014so, put your money aside, invest it\u2014secondly, which is somewhat contradictory: happiness consists in the possession of things.", " A lot of people, when they feel inadequate, bored, unfulfilled, try to get rid of this sensation by going shopping.", " A lot of people spend all their daytime shopping.", " That\u2019s the thing to do.", " You go out and shop.", " There are women galore who go into San Francisco every day just to shop and come back loaded with all kinds of things.", " But these things are not true material possessions\u2014for at least two reasons.", " Number one: most of them aren\u2019t well-made.", " Number two: you can\u2019t use that many things.", " You can store them, you can put them

broadcasting, and the more we develop micro-electric machinery the greater the capacity for discrimination on the dial.", " See, as it is, you get a lot of interference and therefore it cuts out the possibility of an innumerable cluster of stations.", " But as the technology becomes more perfect, you can receive an enormous number of different stations.", " And these stations will increasingly have machinery that makes them fairly simple to run.", " For example, with a video tape machine now made by Ampex costing $6,000 and a Sony television camera costing $250 you could produce a television show with only one technician.", " The average TV show produced in a studio requires 14 technicians to handle it.", " So as this happens, you see, it means that there can be an increasing variety of the kind of material that is presented through the electronic channels.", "McLuhan adds to this a kind of strange point of view, which is that it really doesn\u2019t matter what kind of

learning something, a few words should be said, even though I warn you, that by explaining these things to you, I shall subject you to a very serious hoax.", "Because if I allow you to leave here this evening, under the impression that you understand something about Zen, you will have missed the point entirely.", " Because Zen is a way of life, a state of being, that is not possible to embrace in any concept whatsoever, so that any concepts, any ideas, any words that I shall put across to you this evening will have as their object, showing you the limitations of words and of thinking.", "Now then, if one must try to say something about what Zen is, and I want to do this by way of introduction, I must make it emphatic that Zen, in its essence, is not a doctrine.", " There's nothing you're supposed to believe in.", " It's not a philosophy in our sense, that is to say a set of ideas, an intellectual net in which one tries to catch the fish of reality.", " Actually, the fish of reality is

it is changing.", " And when you're thrown into the water after being accustomed to living on the dry land, you're not used to the idea of swimming.", " You try to stand on the water, you try to catch hold of it, and as a result you drown.", " The only way to survive in the water, and this refers particularly to the waters of modern philosophical confusion, where God is dead, metaphysical propositions are meaningless, and there's really nothing to hang on to, because we're all just falling apart.", " And the only thing to do under those circumstances is to learn how to swim.", " And to swim, you relax, you let go, you give yourself to the water, and you have to know how to breathe in the right way.", " And then you find that the water holds you up; indeed, in a certain way you become the water.", " And so in the same way, one might say if one attempted to\u2014again I say misleadingly\u2014to put Zen into any sort of concept, it simply comes down to this:.", "That in this universe, there is one great energy, and we have no name for it.", " People have tried various names for it, like God, like Brahman, like Tao, but in the West, the word God has got so many funny associations attached to it that most of us are bored with it.", " When people say God the father almighty, most people feel funny inside.", " So we like to hear new words, we like to hear about Tao, about Brahman, about Shinto, and __-__-__, and such strange names from the far East because they don't carry the same associations of mawkish sanctimony and funny meanings from the past.", " And

from the Sanskrit as 'suchness' or 'thusness' or something like that, really means something more like 'dadada,' based on the word tat (\u0924\u0924\u094d), which in Sanskrit means 'that,' and so in

inferior to human consciousness in quality.", " Ernst Haeckel, a biologist of that time, would think of the energy of the universe as blind energy.", " And correspondingly, it seems to me that Freud

selection and by survival of the fittest.", " And therefore, man was in general seen as a fluke of nature\u2014an embodiment of reason, emotion, and values for which the more basic processes of nature

chief and ruler of nature in the image of God, and the time has now dawned upon us all when our attempts to beat nature into submission are having alarming results.", " Because we see that it\u2019s

rituals, as there are also rituals with religion.", " There is the sacrament of the couch, there is the spiritual discipline of free association, there is the mystic knowledge of the interpretation of dreams, and there are also the two great symbolic fetishes, the long one and the round one.", "Now, it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to make fun of all this, and we must not forget that we owe a tremendous debt to Freud, if for nothing else than pointing out that that much of ourselves of which we are aware in terms of the conscious ego is not really ourselves, it is something superficial.",

revelation, there\u2019s no question about that.", " But one sees troublesome signs when the doctrines and processes of psychiatry, psychoanalysis and so forth become officialized, and I think Thomas

things to be true.", " Despite the fact that they change their opinions often while they hold them, they have, in effect, the force of dogma, as witness the anathematization of Velikovsky for his uncomfortable ideas.", " And therefore, there are heresies existing today which are persecuted in the same way as heresies were persecuted by the Holy inquisition.", " And they are persecuted out of kindness in exactly the same way that the holy inquisition persecuted heresy out of kindness and deep concern for human beings.", " That is unimaginable to us, but it was so.", " For, after all, if
